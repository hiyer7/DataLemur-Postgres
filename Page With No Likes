select pages.page_id from page_likes 
right join pages
using(page_id)
where liked_date IS NULL;

select pages.page_id
from pages
where not exists(
Select 1
from page_likes
where pages.page_id = page_likes.page_id and page_likes.liked_date is not null)
order by 1 DESC


The second method works better with large datasets 
especially when there' an index built on page_id
Also Not exists is immune to null values
